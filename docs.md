Based on this snippet, it’s clear that **Google News’ HTML is very dynamic** and not straightforward for basic requests + BeautifulSoup scraping. You can see that the page includes a lot of nested tags, JavaScript data blocks, and inline JSON. In practice:

1. **Much of the data is embedded in inline JSON** (in `<script>` tags, for instance).
2. **Titles** sometimes appear in nested `<a>` tags with classes like `DY5T1d` (in some regions) or `JtKRv` or `WwrzSb`.
3. **Summaries** (the text paragraphs) may not appear at all, or may be embedded in script blocks rather than in standard `<p>` elements.
4. The page uses a lot of JavaScript to render or rewrite the DOM, so **BeautifulSoup** on the raw HTML might not see everything you see in a browser.

In other words, **the snippet alone won’t solve the “No Title Found” or empty summary** problem. Here’s what it shows:

---

## 1. Google News Is Using a Heavily Scripted Layout

If you scroll through the snippet:

- There are `<article>` tags, but the actual text might be inside nested `<a>` or `<div>` with random classes (e.g., `IFHyqb`, `WwrzSb`, `JtKRv`, etc.).  
- Some data (titles, URLs) is **inline** in `<script>` blocks or JSON objects like `"CBMi3AFBVV..."`.  

Hence, your initial approach with:
```python
article.find('h3')  # or
article.find('a', class_='DY5T1d')
```
…may fail, because the HTML you get in a raw `requests.get()` might not match the HTML structure after the JavaScript runs in your browser.

---

## 2. Observing Potential Selectors

Inside the snippet, you might see references like:
```html
<a class="WwrzSb" jsname="hXwDdf" ...>Kim Kardashian's Tesla photoshoot backfires ...</a>
```
or
```html
<a class="JtKRv"
   href="./read/CBMi3AFBVV..."
   data-n-tid="29"
   target="_blank"
   tabindex="0"
   jsaction="click:kkIcoc;"
>Kim Kardashian's Tesla photoshoot backfires ...</a>
```
But these classes (`WwrzSb`, `JtKRv`, etc.) can change depending on region or Google’s layout updates.  

You might also see text like:
```html
<h3 class="hgyOfc">Kim Kardashian&#39;s Tesla robot photoshoot</h3>
```
But in many regions, Google has replaced `<h3>` with custom `<a>` or `<span>` elements.

## 3. Inline JSON

The snippet also shows big JSON data blocks inside `<script>` tags, for example:
```html
<script class="ds:1" nonce="ofY322ESPFGzc77WHZt0Vw">AF_initDataCallback({...})</script>
```
Inside these, you might find all the article metadata—titles, descriptions, URLs, etc. That’s often how Google News (and many other sites) embed content for client-side rendering.  

If you want to parse that JSON, you would have to:

1. **Grab the entire `<script>` block** that calls `AF_initDataCallback`.  
2. **Extract the JSON** inside it.  
3. **Parse** that JSON to find article titles, links, etc.  

However, that’s quite a bit of custom logic, and the format can change.  

---

## 4. Why You Still See "No Title Found"

Even with this snippet, your code might still produce `"No Title Found"` or `"Summary not available"` because:

1. **The titles** might not be in the `<h3>` or `<a>` that you’re looking for.  
2. The site might require JavaScript to fully render. If the data is only placed into the DOM after JavaScript runs, a simple `requests.get()` plus BeautifulSoup won’t see it.  

---

## 5. Workarounds

1. **Use a Headless Browser**  
   Tools like **Selenium** or **Playwright** let you run a full browser that executes JavaScript, so you see the final DOM exactly as in your real browser. Then you can parse out `<a>` or `<div>` text.  

2. **Parse the Inline JSON**  
   - Perform `requests.get()`.  
   - Search for the `<script>` blocks that have something like `AF_initDataCallback`.  
   - Use regex or string searching to extract the JSON portion.  
   - Load it with `json.loads()`.  
   - Dig around in the resulting Python dict to find your articles.  
   This is brittle, though, because Google might reorder or rename keys at any time.  

3. **Use a News API**  
   If your goal is to get structured data about “Tesla” news, using an official News API (e.g., **NewsAPI.org**, **MediaStack**, or **Bing News Search API**) is simpler. You get stable JSON, consistent fields for titles, descriptions, and links.  

4. **Use Another Source**  
   If you only need 10–15 news articles, you can pick a more stable aggregator or an official site’s RSS feed.

## 6. Conclusion

The snippet does confirm:

- Google News is heavily reliant on dynamic JavaScript and embedded JSON data.
- The relevant HTML tags for titles are not guaranteed to be simple `<h3>` or `<p>` elements.  
- A naive approach with `article.find('h3')` or `article.find('a', class_='DY5T1d')` might fail because the final rendered structure differs from the raw HTML.

Therefore, **just this snippet** doesn’t solve the “No Title Found” problem. You either need:

- **A headless browser approach** (Selenium/Playwright), or  
- **Parsing the JSON** inside `<script>` blocks, or  
- **A stable News API** instead of Google News.  

That’s why, even with the snippet, you may still see empty titles or empty summaries using standard BeautifulSoup on the raw HTML.
